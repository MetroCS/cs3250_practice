# Rules (Acceptance Criteria)

### Defining Alternatives:
- The interface must allow the Decision-Maker to create and name multiple alternatives that represent different choices for the decision they are facing.

### Editing and Deleting Alternatives:
- Users can modify or delete an alternative theyâ€™ve previously defined, giving flexibility to adjust the alternatives before beginning the evaluation process.

### Alternative Review:
- The interface should provide a summary view of all defined alternatives, ensuring users can review their input before proceeding to rate each one against the decision criteria.
