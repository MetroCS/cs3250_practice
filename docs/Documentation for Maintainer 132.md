**Documentation for Maintainer - Automated generation of Javadocs (API)**

[**#132**](https://github.com/MetroCS/cs3250_practice/issues/132)


Purpose: The generate Javadoc target in build.xml automates formatted Javadoc generation, ensuring accessible and up-to-date API documentation for maintainers.

Structure and Functionality:

- Target: generate Javadoc in build.xml, generates Java docs for public/protected classes, methods, and fields.
- Output: Stored in /docs/javadocs, providing a consistent location for review.
- Configuration: Uses Java’s standard doclet with custom settings for encoding and visibility levels.

Expected Behavior:

1. Javadoc Creation: Running the target generates complete Java docs in /docs/javadocs with package summaries and class/method details.
1. Log Confirmation: Build log confirms successful generation with a timestamp.
1. Error-Free: Process completes without warnings or errors for clear, readable documentation.

Testing & Validation:

1. Target Execution: Run generate Javadoc in isolation.
1. Output Check: Ensure /docs/javadocs contains the full API documentation.
1. Log Review: Confirm log shows “Javadoc generation complete.”
1. Content Validation: Randomly inspect class documentation for completeness and accuracy.
